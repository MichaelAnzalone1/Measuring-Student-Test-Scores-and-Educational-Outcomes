# STA-215-Final-Project: Measuring-Student-Test-Scores-and-Educational-Outcomes
My replication package for my STA-215 final project. This project investigates the relationship between student absenteeism and reading test scores to determine whether absenteeism has a significant effect on academic performance. Using a dataset of student absences and their associated reading test scores, the project employs an anova test to evaluate potential correlations and causations.

# Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA215-ANZALONE.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "raw_data.csv" file.

# Data
The dataset for this project includes information on student absenteeism, analyzed to determine if absenteeism is a significant issue within schools. Absenteeism was measured, categorizing districts into those with or without an absenteeism problem based on a threshold. The dataset also includes average reading test scores, grades offered, and student-teacher ratios for each district. This analysis aims to determine whether absenteeism correlates with student reading performance, providing insight into the broader impact of attendance on academic outcomes.

# Operationalization
To operationalize absenteeism, I categorized districts based on whether they have an absenteeism problem or not. Districts with this were identified as having significant absenteeism problems, while those without were categorized as not having an absenteeism problem.

Reading test scores were operationalized using the average standardized test results for each district. These scores served as a quantitative measure of academic performance, providing a clear indicator of student outcomes.

The concept of "grades offered" was operationalized by categorizing school districts based on the range of grades they provide. For example, categories included K-6, K-8, and K-12, representing different educational structures across districts.

The student-teacher ratio was operationalized by gathering the data from New Jersey's department of education. This metric served as a contextual variable, offering insights into resource allocation and its potential impact on both absenteeism and academic performance.

Statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and ANOVA tests, were employed to examine the relationships among these variables. ANOVA tests were the primary method used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in reading test scores between districts with and without absenteeism problems.
